# üìå What is Go (Golang)?

**Go**, also called **Golang**, is an **open-source programming language** created by **Google** in **2007** and released publicly in **2009**.

It was designed by **Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson** (three legendary software engineers from Google).

## üîë Key Features of Go

1. **Compiled Language**

   * Go is compiled into machine code, so it runs very fast (comparable to C/C++).

2. **Statically Typed**

   * Variables must have types, but Go also supports type inference (`:=`).

3. **Simple Syntax**

   * Easier to learn compared to C++ or Java, yet very powerful.

4. **Built-in Concurrency**

   * Go has **goroutines** and **channels** for running multiple tasks at once.
   * This makes it excellent for network servers, cloud apps, and distributed systems.

5. **Garbage Collection**

   * Memory management is automatic, so you don‚Äôt need to manually free memory.

6. **Cross-Platform**

   * Write once, run anywhere (Linux, Windows, macOS).

7. **Standard Library**

   * Provides a rich set of packages for web, cryptography, file handling, concurrency, etc.

## üñ•Ô∏è Example: A Simple Go Program

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

üîπ **Explanation:**

* `package main` ‚Üí defines the main package (entry point).
* `import "fmt"` ‚Üí imports the format package for input/output.
* `func main()` ‚Üí execution starts here.
* `fmt.Println()` ‚Üí prints text to the screen.

## ‚ö° Why Use Go?

* **Speed**: Runs close to C/C++ performance.
* **Concurrency**: Best choice for modern applications like servers, APIs, cloud services.
* **Simplicity**: Clean, readable, and beginner-friendly.
* **Scalability**: Used in high-traffic systems like YouTube, Dropbox, Docker, Kubernetes.
* **Community & Support**: Backed by Google, widely used in industry.

## üìå Who Uses Go?

* **Google** (for internal services)
* **Uber** (for real-time services)
* **Netflix** (microservices)
* **Dropbox** (backend systems)
* **Docker & Kubernetes** (written in Go)

## step 02 : Environment setup
-   IDE/Text Editor : such as VSCode
-   Go Compiler : compiler translete the Source code into Machin code.
-   go extension for VSCode : Go 

## step 03 : File Structur

## Step 04 : Tokens 
## step 05 : escape sequences and comment
## step 06 : keyword & Data types
## step 07 : Variable
